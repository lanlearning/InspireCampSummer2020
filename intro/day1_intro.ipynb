I will be graduating from Berkeley this December, and hope to get a job related to using Data Science for sports and education in the future.\n",

So I decided to start LanLearning as an organization through which I can provide students with guidance and materials for their education. It was sitting idle for a while, but this summer I decided to use the paltform I built on Instagram and see if I can put together this summer camp. \n",
