This new column will be labeled ```\"General Area\"``` and have values of ```\"West Coast\"```, ```\"East Coast\"```, and ```\"Neither Coast\"```. <br> <br> First, you need to **define a method** called ```get_general_area(state)``` which **takes in the state** (which is a String, as all the values in the ```State``` column are Strings) that the national park is located in, and **returns either ```\"West Coast\"```, ```\"East Coast\"```, or ```\"Neither Coast\"``` (all String values) depending on the given state**. We've provided you lists of all the states that are on each coast for you to use in your function. (**Hint**: remember all the way back to python4? We used the membership operator ```in``` to check if a value was in another value. You might want to use it here.) <br> <br> Note: a few of the national parks are located in multiple states as you can tell by the comma separating the state abbreviations. These select national parks will always return ```\"Neither Coast\"``` because its ```State``` attribute is longer than the Strings in the coast lists. Example: ```\"CA, NV\"``` can never be in ```\"CA\"``` because it's bigger! You don't need to do anything about this though. You can just let it be. Just code the function as if the given value was only one state."
